# boroughManifestoTargets

This repository is for the creation of the borough manifesto target's wheel.

This idea has been borrowed from the Health related Wheel of wellbeing which was created by ONS / Public Health and subsequently taken down from the web.

This wheel will use store the target areas and using D3 shall display further information about each indicator when items are clicked on.

This project began on 23rd April 2018 and shall take around three months to complete.
